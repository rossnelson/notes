Before we start our family study, is there anything you
would like to cover?

**Dade** 

No, Not really.

**Ross** 

Are you sure? You've seemed awfully serious lately.

**Dade** 

Well, I, have been thinking a lot about this kid at school. he is just 
so depressed all the time. Im not sure why, but I was thinking if he knew
Jehovah and the truth it would really help him.

Do you think you could help me come up with something I can talk to him about?

**Ross**

You know, it's commendable that you took notice of your classmate. And
your right, learning about Jehovah can be a great motivator for change 
in a person's life.

For starter's what can we look to everyday that reflects Jehovah's qualities?

**Dade**

Are you thinking his creations?

**Ross**

Yep, can you read _Romans 1:20_ to back that up.

> “His invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world’s creation onward, 
> because they are perceived by the things made, even his eternal power and 
> Godship, so that they are inexcusable.”

It says, they are inexcusable, Seeing Jehovah's compassion, humor and power reflected in
all his creations will help our appreciation for him grow. What is something 
you appreciate about Jehovah's creations?

**Dade**

I like the fact that Jehovah's creativity is so endless. There are millions of
identified species of living things on the earth and I just read that there might
be 10 to 30 million more species scientists have not discovered yet.

**Ross**

Yeah, and I often think of Jehovah's power in
controlling all the heavenly bodies. Think about all the objects flying through 
space and yet, rarely they enter the earths atmosphere. When they does, so often they
just burns up to create beautiful shooting stars across the sky.

Both are very powerful topics to share with your friend. Why don't you explain 
how they reflect Jehovah's qualities and how you meditate on these things. 

**Dade**

Oh Yeah, I know a scripture that talks about that. _1 Timothy 4:15_

**Ross**

Ok, I can read that.

> “Ponder over these things; be absorbed in them, so that your advancement may 
> be plainly seen by all people.”

That's a good one, what does meditating on the things we learn about Jehovah do
for us? 

**Dade**

Well it makes him more real to us and draws us closer to him.

**Ross**

Right, and when it comes to studying Jehovah's word, meditating enables us to 
assimilate what we read and to develop appreciation for it.

Remember what _Joshua 1:8_ says about prayer,

> and you must read it in an undertone* day and night, in order to observe 
> carefully all that is written in it;

While your friend is pondering the things he has learned what else
can he do that will help him draw even closer to Jehovah? 

**Dade**

Well usually I like to say a prayer and thank Jehovah whenever I find something 
I really appreciate. 

**Ross**

Good, can you read _James 1:5_ And lets think about how prayer helps you solidify
what you have learned about Jehovah.

**Dade**

> “If any one of you is lacking in wisdom, let him keep asking God, for he gives 
> generously to all and without reproaching, and it will be given him.”

I can definitely talk to my classmate about prayer. Talking to
Jehovah about my problems always makes me feel better.

**Ross**

That would be great. Lets read one last scripture, _Hebrews 10:24, 25_ just the first part of 25. 

> “Let us consider one another so as to incite to love and fine works, not 
> forsaking our meeting together.”

**Dade** Ahhh, So, maybe, if he is interested, I could invite him to join us 
next Sunday for the meeting.

**Ross** You've got it. Now we can start our study.
